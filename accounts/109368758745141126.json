I played Football in HS and coached HS football. Generally, I love Football. I'm a 3rd generation wrestling fan (interesting story). I like to go to local shows in Chicago. I'm not company-centric but I do like AEW because it reminds me of 80 and early 90 NWA. Helps it's on Turner Broadcasting. I'm personable and I'm willing to talk.
