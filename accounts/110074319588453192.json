I started creating pop culture art to escape my daily life. Today, I create individually focused art, so if that is something that sounds interesting, I hope you follow me here, and feel free to reach out to me and ask me questions about this or anything else.<\/p>"],"url":["https://mastodon.social/@sociallyawkward"],"avatar":["https://files.mastodon.social/accounts/avatars/110/074/319/588/453/192/original/477193a2bf4218f8.png"],"avatar_static":["https://files.mastodon.social/accounts/avatars/110/074/319/588/453/192/original/477193a2bf4218f8.png"],"header":["https://files.mastodon.social/accounts/headers/110/074/319/588/453/192/original/05c3f31fa8bf4e24.jpg"],"header_static":["https://files.mastodon.social/accounts/headers/110/074/319/588/453/192/original/05c3f31fa8bf4e24.jpg"],"followers_count":[3],"following_count":[55],"statuses_count":[1],"fields":[{"name":"Artist","value":"Pop culture, art, marketing, social media"}],"emojis":[]}
