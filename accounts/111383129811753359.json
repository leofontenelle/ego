I am a black 25-year-old female. I am asexual.  I am currently in my second semester of college. My favorite color is black. I like to write stories about messed-up queer people. I can read morally grey stuff because it is fiction, and I can recognize that. I like nice, weird, or interesting people. I hate people who try to censor or police what queer people do.  Especially when it comes from inside the community. Also, I&#39;m shy and probably neurodivergent, so keep that in mind.<\/p>"],"url":["https://mastodon.social/@TheAsexualMortification"],"avatar":["https://files.mastodon.social/accounts/avatars/111/383/129/811/753/359/original/2d8495bc03427b60.jpg"],"avatar_static":["https://files.mastodon.social/accounts/avatars/111/383/129/811/753/359/original/2d8495bc03427b60.jpg"],"header":["https://mastodon.social/headers/original/missing.png"],"header_static":["https://mastodon.social/headers/original/missing.png"],"followers_count":[0],"following_count":[1],"statuses_count":[1],"fields":[{"name":"she/her","value":""},{"name":"25","value":""}],"emojis":[],"discoverable":[null]}
