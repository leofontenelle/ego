Often skeptical. Occasionally sniffing where I shouldn’t.  Always happy to see you. Happily living in the far north of Minnesota, watching a bit of hockey or football “SKOL,” hiking around, or I’ll just hop in the boat and hope someone will take me somewhere…. Ope!  I enjoy being curious about everything.  As a private individual, I also know connection with others in meaningful ways is what it’s all about.
