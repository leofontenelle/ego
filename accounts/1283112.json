My name is Brett and my focus in the videos I create will be the illumination and exaltation of yesterday's and today's greatest philosophical minds. My goal is to not only convey their thoughts, ideas, and philosophies, but to also give these ideas practical meaning so that you may use them to better your own lives. If you're interested in learning about philosophy and applying philosophic principles to your life, check out a few of my videos. Even if philosophy has never really caught your gaze, you may find after little investigation how seductive and enveloping dialectic conversation can be."],"url":["https://tilvids.com/accounts/letstalkphilosophy"],"uri":["https://tilvids.com/accounts/letstalkphilosophy"],"avatar":["https://files.mastodon.social/cache/accounts/avatars/001/283/112/original/9fa520a888471dfc.jpg"],"avatar_static":["https://files.mastodon.social/cache/accounts/avatars/001/283/112/original/9fa520a888471dfc.jpg"],"header":["https://mastodon.social/headers/original/missing.png"],"header_static":["https://mastodon.social/headers/original/missing.png"],"followers_count":[808],"following_count":[0],"statuses_count":[19],"last_status_at":["2024-10-08"],"hide_collections":[true],"emojis":[],"fields":[]}
