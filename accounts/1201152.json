I have lived in Louisville, Ky since 1995.   I love the outdoors and nature, and have a down to earth, grassroots progressive outlook on life politically and spiritually.   I&#39;m a quite healthy, nearly 66 year young lady.  I can&#39;t really retire but I like to say that I&#39;m semi retired as I work week days pretty much full time doing ubereats.   It may sort of be &quot;grunt work&quot;, and not necessarily inspiring.
