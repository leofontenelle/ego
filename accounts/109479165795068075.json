I kept finding and following people on infosec.exchange and decided to just create an account here as well so my Local is made up of all of you. <\/p><p>I've spent the last 15+ years working in legal tech. Mostly ediscovery and running/maintaining an in-house document review platform along with supporting the legal teams using it. Occasionally play sales engineer. Some forensics early on but recently more involved on the network ops and security side. Really enjoying that and want to be more involved in the infosec community because I feel like that's where my path is heading. Looking forward to infosec conferences in 2023 and meeting people in the community.<\/p><p>interests: My dogs, <a href=\"https://infosec.exchange/tags/HamRadio\" class=\"mention hashtag\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">#<span>HamRadio<\/span><\/a> <a href=\"https://infosec.exchange/tags/linux\" class=\"mention hashtag\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">#<span>linux<\/span><\/a> <a href=\"https://infosec.exchange/tags/3DPrinting\" class=\"mention hashtag\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">#<span>3DPrinting<\/span><\/a> <a href=\"https://infosec.exchange/tags/photography\" class=\"mention hashtag\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">#<span>photography<\/span><\/a> <a href=\"https://infosec.exchange/tags/BackyardChickens\" class=\"mention hashtag\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">#<span>BackyardChickens<\/span><\/a> and tinkering with the kinds of things adafruit sells. <\/p><p>He/him<\/p>"],"url":["https://infosec.exchange/@beep"],"avatar":["https://files.mastodon.social/cache/accounts/avatars/109/479/165/795/068/075/original/e1ba8fdf18e4995c.png"],"avatar_static":["https://files.mastodon.social/cache/accounts/avatars/109/479/165/795/068/075/original/e1ba8fdf18e4995c.png"],"header":["https://mastodon.social/headers/original/missing.png"],"header_static":["https://mastodon.social/headers/original/missing.png"],"followers_count":[31],"following_count":[158],"statuses_count":[150],"fields":[{"name":"BookWyrm","value":"<a href=\"https://books.infosec.exchange/user/beep\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" translate=\"no\" target=\"_blank\"><span class=\"invisible\">https://<\/span><span class=\"ellipsis\">books.infosec.exchange/user/be<\/span><span class=\"invisible\">ep<\/span><\/a>"}],"emojis":[],"discoverable":[false]}
