I mainly make 8-bit NES/FamiTracker arrangements of nostalgic game soundtracks from my childhood like DPPt, PMD2 and HGSS (but also other types of music) that you can listen to on PeerTube <a href=\"https://makertube.net/@lily_bit_music\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">https://makertube.net/@lily_bit_music<\/a> and YouTube <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCFLp8Is-lEMpQvhoY95Gorg\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCFLp8Is-lEMpQvhoY95Gorg<\/a> or any music streaming service :acnh_jamming_to_music:<\/p><p>I also like drawing, mainly pixel art of cute characters and of course the art or sometimes animations for my music videos, and I have several OCs that mean a lot to me (that are not yet public but will be soon). :wigglytuff_wide_open_smile: :wigglytuff_omg:<\/p><p>Messing around with computers has been a passion of mine since I was very young. I use Arch Linux + KDE + Wayland, a PinePhone + Keyboard running Arch + Sxmo and I self-host stuff like this GoToSocial instance on my home server. I‚Äôm not a fan of stuff like crypto and AI, though. :xenia_laptop:<\/p><p>I love Star Trek, I started watching chronologically in 2021 (present location: concluding TNG with the films). The stories and the people writing them give me hope that an entirely different society is possible. Infinite diversity in infinite combinations; live long and prosper! üññ<\/p><p>Currently I describe myself as a bisexual (admitted to myself in 2023) non-binary trans girl (admitted to myself in 2022). Except for people very close to me, I‚Äôm still closeted IRL. I‚Äôm still figuring myself out and very slowly gathering the courage to try new things. I‚Äôm also likely neurodivergent which has been confirmed but not yet fully diagnosed by professionals. :blobhaj_heart_trans: :blobhaj_flag_bisexual:<\/p><p>I‚Äôm very introverted and shy, so I don‚Äôt engage in conversations often and usually just give likes.
