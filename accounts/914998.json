Their on-screen chemistry was amazing, and I was very sad when it was over. I found myself think a lot about how the two of them should be together, and after some research, I discovered I wasn&#39;t the only one. There are too many things about their situations that make no sense. So, after some extremely toxic things were posted on the Tumblr fandom, I and a few of my close friends decided to head over here.
