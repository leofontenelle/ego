Gay. Secular Humanist. Atheist. Grew up in evangelical preacher's home, grad. from Christian college, BA in music, was min. of music in churches, keyboardist for a traveling Christian band, but in my late 30s began researching religious origins. Being gay was the catalyst for that search, as I could never truly reconcile it with the bigotry of Christianity.
