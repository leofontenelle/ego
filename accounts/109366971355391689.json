Originally from Long Island, NY, USA.  On Twitter, I'm @feuermathdoc.  I'm a fan of Dr. Who followed by Star Wars.  Not much of a trekkie but I'm familiar with a lot of it.  I'm a coffee snob.  I'm a fan of many NY sports teams (read my intro for dets).  For video games, my favorites are Diablo (especially 3) and extremely similar (like Titan Quest and Torchlights) as well as train simulators and some city builders.
