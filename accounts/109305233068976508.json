Trainee curmudgeon. Legal background but stepped back from that now. Wasn't particularly political until fairly recently. I follow current affairs avidly. Brexit was a bad thing. Not quite sure about Independence though but willing to listen and be persuaded. Curry lover. Football fan. DIYer (never finish anything). Likes most music (apart from rap). Plays guitar sometimes (badly). Likes older cars and always kind to animals.<\/p>"],"url":["https://mastodon.scot/@gogsymac"],"uri":["https://mastodon.scot/users/gogsymac"],"avatar":["https://mastodon.social/avatars/original/missing.png"],"avatar_static":["https://mastodon.social/avatars/original/missing.png"],"header":["https://mastodon.social/headers/original/missing.png"],"header_static":["https://mastodon.social/headers/original/missing.png"],"followers_count":[21],"following_count":[115],"statuses_count":[1],"last_status_at":["2022-12-19"],"hide_collections":[false],"emojis":[],"fields":[]}
