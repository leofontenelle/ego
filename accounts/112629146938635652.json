I'm Melissa Roe, and I've been totally blind since birth, in my late 30s and bisexual. I'm a graduate student working part-time as an AT trainer while I complete my master's in special education. I live in California with my husband and retired guide dog. I enjoy podcasting, creative writing, reading, dream interpretations and discussions about spirituality and psychology. Looking forward to the connection with friends old and new.<\/p>"],"url":["https://chatwithus.live/@desertstar84"],"uri":["https://chatwithus.live/users/desertstar84"],"avatar":["https://mastodon.social/avatars/original/missing.png"],"avatar_static":["https://mastodon.social/avatars/original/missing.png"],"header":["https://mastodon.social/headers/original/missing.png"],"header_static":["https://mastodon.social/headers/original/missing.png"],"followers_count":[322],"following_count":[259],"statuses_count":[610],"last_status_at":["2024-10-25"],"hide_collections":[false],"emojis":[],"fields":[]}
