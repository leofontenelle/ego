I've been interested in far too many things in my life. When people here about my licenses, certifications, etc., they wonder when I had time to do anything else.  Adore Star Trek, and love Space, especially Apollo, I was around for those.  I have a Ham Radio license, but haven't done much more than local VHF/UHF.  Interested in Military History, especially WW2.  Adore sailing and aviation but am prone to motion sickness!
