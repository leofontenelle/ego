Interests include reading, cycling, and a wee bit of politics, a bit left leaning, and fully supportive of the nurses and the train workers. A fervent European. Canâ€™t think of a single benefit that came from Brexit. Loved wandering around Europe as a free citizen rather than the current shambles when travelling there. Music - mainly a folk, Americana taste. Like Townes , Guy Clark etc.<\/p>"],"url":["https://mastodon.scot/@Shorrus"],"uri":["https://mastodon.scot/users/Shorrus"],"avatar":["https://files.mastodon.social/cache/accounts/avatars/109/347/620/482/524/723/original/a3fe6760eb6a8062.jpeg"],"avatar_static":["https://files.mastodon.social/cache/accounts/avatars/109/347/620/482/524/723/original/a3fe6760eb6a8062.jpeg"],"header":["https://files.mastodon.social/cache/accounts/headers/109/347/620/482/524/723/original/b107b4a046a577d6.jpeg"],"header_static":["https://files.mastodon.social/cache/accounts/headers/109/347/620/482/524/723/original/b107b4a046a577d6.jpeg"],"followers_count":[31],"following_count":[68],"statuses_count":[34],"last_status_at":["2022-12-11"],"hide_collections":[false],"emojis":[],"fields":[]}
