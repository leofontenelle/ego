I'm someone who loves trying out different open-source software, creating awesome graphic designs, 3D printing cool stuff, making animations, and writing. My biggest passion is creating top-notch security products. I'm really interested in the nitty-gritty details of technology and privacy issues. I believe that if product management and security teams work together, we can make amazing products that solve big problems.
