I earned my PhD in English from the U of Washington. Since a child I've been fascinated by marionettes, planetariums, wax museums, and dodos. More recently I've taken interests in biblical authorship and colonial American history. I read Peter Ackroyd, William Gibson, and Salman Rushdie. My favorite TV shows are Deadwood and Green Acres.<\/p>"],"url":["https://home.social/@rtrac3y"],"uri":["https://home.social/users/rtrac3y"],"avatar":["https://files.mastodon.social/cache/accounts/avatars/109/367/488/161/873/960/original/9a2ba12b515dfc42.jpg"],"avatar_static":["https://files.mastodon.social/cache/accounts/avatars/109/367/488/161/873/960/original/9a2ba12b515dfc42.jpg"],"header":["https://files.mastodon.social/cache/accounts/headers/109/367/488/161/873/960/original/fbcd9089b6b75bd3.jpeg"],"header_static":["https://files.mastodon.social/cache/accounts/headers/109/367/488/161/873/960/original/fbcd9089b6b75bd3.jpeg"],"followers_count":[5],"following_count":[62],"statuses_count":[14],"last_status_at":["2022-12-05"],"hide_collections":[false],"emojis":[],"fields":[]}
