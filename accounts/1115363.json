I love to read novels online. I love painting, fishing, and making dishes for my family on weekends. I am from the UK. It is my dream to become a professor, and I am glad I have achieved it. I am married, and I have two beautiful angels. They both are studying in school. My daughter told me that they are not good at writing an essay, so they are thinking about taking help from Edubirdie writers.<\/p>"],"url":["https://mastodon.social/@JoannMPrice"],"uri":["https://mastodon.social/users/JoannMPrice"],"avatar":["https://files.mastodon.social/accounts/avatars/001/115/363/original/a80678ba38e74f81.jpg"],"avatar_static":["https://files.mastodon.social/accounts/avatars/001/115/363/original/a80678ba38e74f81.jpg"],"header":["https://mastodon.social/headers/original/missing.png"],"header_static":["https://mastodon.social/headers/original/missing.png"],"followers_count":[0],"following_count":[1],"statuses_count":[0],"last_status_at":{},"hide_collections":{},"noindex":[false],"emojis":[],"roles":[],"fields":[]}
