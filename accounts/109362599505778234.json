Someone's Mother, Wife, Daughter, Sister, Colleague, Neighbour etc. I dislike partisan reporting via media moguls and believe it strongly interferes with democracy. On a lighter note, I sometimes dabble in making fermented foods, try to get my daily steps in (realising I don't always succeed) and often tend to buy more books than I have the time to read. You will regularly find me on here or crocheting in my down time.<\/p>"],"url":["https://mastodon.au/@ozrockchick"],"uri":["https://mastodon.au/users/ozrockchick"],"avatar":["https://files.mastodon.social/cache/accounts/avatars/109/362/599/505/778/234/original/5fe3e2fb466ae1ff.jpg"],"avatar_static":["https://files.mastodon.social/cache/accounts/avatars/109/362/599/505/778/234/original/5fe3e2fb466ae1ff.jpg"],"header":["https://files.mastodon.social/cache/accounts/headers/109/362/599/505/778/234/original/78ff65efe6a126b3.jpeg"],"header_static":["https://files.mastodon.social/cache/accounts/headers/109/362/599/505/778/234/original/78ff65efe6a126b3.jpeg"],"followers_count":[258],"following_count":[537],"statuses_count":[59],"last_status_at":["2022-12-01"],"hide_collections":[false],"emojis":[],"fields":[]}
