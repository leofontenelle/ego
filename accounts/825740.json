The vast majority of my music collection is from the 1920s to the late 1950s. In that collection is classical music, latin jazz, rock, hiphop and of course, different musics from around the world. I also have many older movies and I love gardening. Growing your own food is both humbling and rewarding. It makes me think of what I put in my body as well as what we give back to the earth.<\/p>"],"url":["https://mastodon.social/@purplerook"],"uri":["https://mastodon.social/users/purplerook"],"avatar":["https://files.mastodon.social/accounts/avatars/000/825/740/original/27c90f8280709a74.png"],"avatar_static":["https://files.mastodon.social/accounts/avatars/000/825/740/original/27c90f8280709a74.png"],"header":["https://files.mastodon.social/accounts/headers/000/825/740/original/1b027be79f18d05e.jpg"],"header_static":["https://files.mastodon.social/accounts/headers/000/825/740/original/1b027be79f18d05e.jpg"],"followers_count":[0],"following_count":[5],"statuses_count":[3],"last_status_at":["2020-09-30"],"hide_collections":[false],"noindex":[true],"emojis":[],"roles":[],"fields":[]}
