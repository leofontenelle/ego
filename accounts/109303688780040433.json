This is the stuff to live for, and what you make of it all. This is mankind created in the image of a jealous godhead. This is fatherhood, the devil god and the golden calf â€” the godly man, a jealous human being. This mode of life is an all-confrontational mode of life, the highs and lows of it, what it actually is. Truth that needs no proof, where every need is an evil need. This is a ballad of outrageous love.<\/p>"],"url":["https://toot.community/@VooduDrew"],"avatar":["https://files.mastodon.social/cache/accounts/avatars/109/303/688/780/040/433/original/ea9de59512a1ae6f.jpeg"],"avatar_static":["https://files.mastodon.social/cache/accounts/avatars/109/303/688/780/040/433/original/ea9de59512a1ae6f.jpeg"],"header":["https://files.mastodon.social/cache/accounts/headers/109/303/688/780/040/433/original/b2ce5fdd278a3a3d.jpeg"],"header_static":["https://files.mastodon.social/cache/accounts/headers/109/303/688/780/040/433/original/b2ce5fdd278a3a3d.jpeg"],"followers_count":[68],"following_count":[197],"statuses_count":[528],"fields":[],"emojis":[]}
