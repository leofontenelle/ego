Hunting is nothing new to me. I get introduced to hunting at an early age and since then spent countless hours in the woods and learned good lessons in terms of woodsmanship. My hunting career is highlighted with some big bugs that other hunters dream to gun down.  To me, sharing of skills and knowledge means helping others.
