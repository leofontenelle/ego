I am multi-passionate and struggling with the thought of how much the universe contains and how little time I get to experience it. But then I remember my cat, my partner, frieands &amp; family, and I feel like I am experiencing the most important parts. I am sort of contructing my own little universe with them in the centre and so much more around it.\nHoping that I will find people with different world views and ideas so that I just dont build my own echo chamber. Wish me luck :)"],"url":["https://pixelfed.social/lampesjarm"],"uri":["https://pixelfed.social/users/lampesjarm"],"avatar":["https://files.mastodon.social/cache/accounts/avatars/110/734/086/838/361/188/original/8886f898bf526aea.jpg"],"avatar_static":["https://files.mastodon.social/cache/accounts/avatars/110/734/086/838/361/188/original/8886f898bf526aea.jpg"],"header":["https://mastodon.social/headers/original/missing.png"],"header_static":["https://mastodon.social/headers/original/missing.png"],"followers_count":[0],"following_count":[5],"statuses_count":[0],"last_status_at":{},"hide_collections":[true],"emojis":[],"fields":[]}
