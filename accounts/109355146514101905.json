I love reading science fiction and fantasy novels, from Asimov to Tchaikovsky (Adrian) and Thompson (Tade), Tolkien and many more. I'll watch a science fiction film even if I know it's terrible and for my sins I tolerate anything with Star Trek on the cover. The Fifth Element is a work of cinematic genius.
