I run a small gallery selling my husband's landscape photography. Previously I worked as a project worker in a centre for the homeless and rootless and later in homeless prevention/tenancy support. I tend to post photos of the Isle of Wight , boost other photos that appeal to me, share what music I'm (and others I follow) are listening to. In my case it's usually rock!
