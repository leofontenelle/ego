I love gardening, writing, photography, SF, and the ghost story/haunted house tale. Current obsession is with paper, notebooks, and pens, specifically Travelers Notebooks. Academic projects currently include Multicultural Speculative Fictions, Black Speculative Fictions, World SF, Inquiry Based Writing Pedagogies, and Creative Writing Pedagogies.
