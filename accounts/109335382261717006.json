He obsesses over speculative fiction and devours stories that explore the mind and our universe. His passion is with fiction and poetry, but deep down he doubts there is a difference. He is a dabbler and traveler, a finder of four-leaf clovers, and a tinkerer with technology, philosophy, and myth. His time is spent reading, studying, tending Basenjis, and polishing dreams.
