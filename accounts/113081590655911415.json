We're not all roses! We get on that sad, doomer-fueled, wistful kinda bender sometimes.<br><br>Federal regulations require me to inform you that this system is lookin' pretty good. We kiss our friends, hand out compliments like candy and just might be cooking up about 20 ideas for the next romantic fanfic in our head while talking to you. <br><br>Anyway, welcome to the show.
