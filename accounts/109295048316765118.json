You might want to send me a DM immediately before sending the follow request, so I know you’re not a bot or marketer; I’ve recently rejected quite a few follow requests as I couldn’t make heads nor tails of the account… or, in some cases, there was just no shared interest apparent.<\/p><p>Mostly interested in cats. Also, good coffee☕, garlic, cats, nature, European paganism, IT (but not those new-fangled hypes; I like <a href=\"https://mbsd.evolvis.org/mksh.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">my Korn Shell<\/a>, Assembly, used to like C; I run VMs, not (never!) containers; I hate the way people try to force systemd upon other people and avoid it and other plagues), garlic, Open Source, cats, music (baroque was the peak of all music, it went downhill from there: Beethoven and Mozart were the beginning of that; love John Rutter’s though, and Nightwish/Tarja…), garlic, cats, good coffee, books, good fanfiction… oh, and, did I mention? Cats! I also dare to sing in choirs and dabble a bit in <a href=\"https://toot.mirbsd.org/tags/teamrecorder\" class=\"mention hashtag\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">#<span>TeamRecorder<\/span><\/a> and <a href=\"https://mbsd.evolvis.org/music/free/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">produce Free Sheet Music<\/a>, and I go geocaching, opencaching, terracaching, … and occasionally play Munzee. I use <a href=\"https://mbsd.evolvis.org/jupp.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">jupp, a WordStar-like editor<\/a> and actually prefer <a href=\"https://mbsd.evolvis.org/man1/ed\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><code>ed(1)<\/code><\/a> over <strong>both<\/strong> vi <em>and<\/em> emacs (*shudder*…).<br>Dogs, systemd advocates and SJWs are not welcome. I don’t come here for deep social discussions or something, so don’t bother me with these. Nor with <em>shudder…<\/em> politics. And I’ll refuse follows from people who endorse ML/LLM (so-called “AI”) and/or content output by them, since the latter is almost always illegal.<\/p><p>My feed <em>will<\/em> include RSS posts from other activity feeds of <a href=\"https://launchpad.net/~mirabilos\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">mine<\/a> (posted via daily cronjob, not in real time, so their post timestamp is irrelevant) as well as boosts and no CWs. Boosts are not my own content and belong to the original poster. I often RT or boost posts I do not understand, e.g. in foreign languages, just because the picture is nice or something. And only one of my clients allows me to set the posting language, unfortunately.<\/p><p>I run my own single-user plus bots (so far, but I might admit personal acquaintances if they really want) instance of GtS so some tech trouble may be expected. No custom “emoji” (really, colon-magic-strings, which I loathed on other platforms already; they should call them stickers, to not be confused with proper Emoji, which are bad enough by themselves…), but longer posts and Markdown formatting. (I hate Markdown, but it’s better than no formatting, I suppose?) It is not permitted to copy or mirror the content from here elsewhere, <strong>especially<\/strong> not widening the visibility scope; this explicitly includes screenshotting.<\/p><p>I’m personnel to Čara🐈‍⬛ (a rescue cat, FIP carrier and FIV+ but she’s so lovely). Black cats (even with white nose, socks and bikini) are the best! We also rescued Malik🐈‍⬛ from the streets in mid-January 2024, he’d been out and fed by locals for about 14–16 months after about 5–7 months of family life, and we hope we can give him a good life and maybe Čara🐈‍⬛ a “little” brother (who’s two times her size). He’s now staying with us indefinitely as well.<\/p><p><a href=\"https://toot.mirbsd.org/tags/noai\" class=\"mention hashtag\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">#<span>noai<\/span><\/a> <a href=\"https://toot.mirbsd.org/tags/nobot\" class=\"mention hashtag\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">#<span>nobot<\/span><\/a> <a href=\"https://toot.mirbsd.org/tags/nobridge\" class=\"mention hashtag\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">#<span>nobridge<\/span><\/a> <a href=\"https://toot.mirbsd.org/tags/noindex\" class=\"mention hashtag\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">#<span>noindex<\/span><\/a> <a href=\"https://toot.mirbsd.org/tags/nootherrandomenshittification\" class=\"mention hashtag\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">#<span>NoOtherRandomEnshittification<\/span><\/a> <a href=\"https://toot.mirbsd.org/tags/rechtaufanalogesleben\" class=\"mention hashtag\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">#<span>RechtAufAnalogesLeben<\/span><\/a><\/p>"],"url":["https://toot.mirbsd.org/@mirabilos"],"avatar":["https://files.mastodon.social/cache/accounts/avatars/109/295/048/316/765/118/original/2f0d4874c45b8528.jpeg"],"avatar_static":["https://files.mastodon.social/cache/accounts/avatars/109/295/048/316/765/118/original/2f0d4874c45b8528.jpeg"],"header":["https://files.mastodon.social/cache/accounts/headers/109/295/048/316/765/118/original/a77983c283282a21.jpg"],"header_static":["https://files.mastodon.social/cache/accounts/headers/109/295/048/316/765/118/original/a77983c283282a21.jpg"],"followers_count":[403],"following_count":[389],"statuses_count":[62736],"fields":[{"name":"rel=\"me\" (plus more links to my stuff)","value":"<a href=\"https://evolvis.org/~tg/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" translate=\"no\"><span class=\"invisible\">https://<\/span><span class=\"\">evolvis.org/~tg/<\/span><span class=\"invisible\"><\/span><\/a>","verified_at":"2024-10-19T10:23:49.159+00:00"},{"name":"just my toots, without boosts","value":"<a href=\"https://justmytoots.com/@mirabilos@toot.mirbsd.org\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">https://justmytoots.com/@mirabilos@toot.mirbsd.org<\/a>"},{"name":"backup account","value":"<a href=\"https://ipv6.camp/@mirabilos\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">https://ipv6.camp/@mirabilos<\/a>"},{"name":"owned by","value":"Čara🐈‍⬛ and Malik🐈‍⬛"},{"name":"LINGUÆ","value":"de-DE-1901, en-DE, 🪫 la, 🪫 nl, 🪫 es, …"}],"emojis":[],"discoverable":[false]}
