I&#39;m told I have an odd sense of humor. I can crack up an entire room of people and usually have someone in my small tribe laughing. I enjoy older computer and test/lab electronics. I do repairs and restorations. I&#39;m currently playing a LOT of Diablo Immortal. I&#39;m semi-retired. I live with my dogs south of Seattle, WA USA.
