We believe in a human-centered world, in which people are not treated like products — for people are people, not products. Now that we have established what people are not, here is what products are not: our family, our friends, acquaintances, lovers — though some would argue otherwise about that one — our ethics, or our ideologies. We look back to the 80s and 90s, when people sought products, not the other way around.<\/p>"],"url":["https://mastodon.social/@darkbit"],"avatar":["https://files.mastodon.social/accounts/avatars/110/003/480/063/125/521/original/af9ba5ab6e353505.png"],"avatar_static":["https://files.mastodon.social/accounts/avatars/110/003/480/063/125/521/original/af9ba5ab6e353505.png"],"header":["https://mastodon.social/headers/original/missing.png"],"header_static":["https://mastodon.social/headers/original/missing.png"],"followers_count":[2],"following_count":[23],"statuses_count":[1],"fields":[],"emojis":[],"discoverable":[true]}
