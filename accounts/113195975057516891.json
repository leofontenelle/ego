I am a professional software engineer, and have been since 2008. I currently do full-stack work, mostly in Python and JavaScript, for a company based in Japan which sells AI-related services. However I am passionate about functional programming languages, especially Haskell, Scheme, and Emacs. I also love retro-computing, especially computers from the late 70s to early 90s, in particular old Apple computers, but I love all old computers from that era. I am also passionate about free/libre software, especially Linux. Most of my posts are about functional programming languages, retro-computing, and Linux.<br><br>I care deeply about human rights and justice for the poor, persecuted, and underprivileged people. I am strongly opposed to war, fascism, and any ideology driven by hatred. I reject all forms of violence except self defense (war and terrorism are never self defense). Climate change is an issue of human rights because it will cause the most harm to the poor and underprivileged. I am especially concerned about large corporations and nation-states using AI as a means of controlling people through targeted advertising, mass surveillance, and \"pre-crime\" policing. Most of the political posts that I boost are about climate change, and the abuse of AI technology.<br><br>Since late 2023, I have been especially horrified by the genocide being committed by the United States and Israel against the people of Palestine, although I now understand that these crimes against humanity have been ongoing almost continuously since 1948. A large number of the posts I boost are about the ongoing genocide against the people of Palestine, as well as all the other innumerable crimes against humanity committed by the states of the US and Israel throughout the Middle East and elsewhere.<br><br><a class=\"hashtag\" href=\"https://fe.disroot.org/tag/tech\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">#tech<\/a> <a class=\"hashtag\" href=\"https://fe.disroot.org/tag/software\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">#Software<\/a> <a class=\"hashtag\" href=\"https://fe.disroot.org/tag/computers\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">#Computers<\/a> <a class=\"hashtag\" href=\"https://fe.disroot.org/tag/linux\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">#Linux<\/a> <a class=\"hashtag\" href=\"https://fe.disroot.org/tag/emacs\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">#Emacs<\/a> <a class=\"hashtag\" href=\"https://fe.disroot.org/tag/lisp\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">#Lisp<\/a> <a class=\"hashtag\" href=\"https://fe.disroot.org/tag/scheme\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">#Scheme<\/a> <a class=\"hashtag\" href=\"https://fe.disroot.org/tag/programminglanguage\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">#ProgrammingLanguage<\/a> <a class=\"hashtag\" href=\"https://fe.disroot.org/tag/gaza\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">#Gaza<\/a> <a class=\"hashtag\" href=\"https://fe.disroot.org/tag/genocide\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">#Genocide<\/a> <a class=\"hashtag\" href=\"https://fe.disroot.org/tag/middleeast\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">#MiddleEast<\/a> <a class=\"hashtag\" href=\"https://fe.disroot.org/tag/war\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">#War<\/a> <a class=\"hashtag\" href=\"https://fe.disroot.org/tag/climatechange\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">#ClimateChange<\/a> <a class=\"hashtag\" href=\"https://fe.disroot.org/tag/globalwarming\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">#GlobalWarming<\/a>"],"url":["https://fe.disroot.org/users/ramin_hal9001"],"avatar":["https://files.mastodon.social/cache/accounts/avatars/113/195/975/057/516/891/original/aeaea571e5b78d58.jpg"],"avatar_static":["https://files.mastodon.social/cache/accounts/avatars/113/195/975/057/516/891/original/aeaea571e5b78d58.jpg"],"header":["https://files.mastodon.social/cache/accounts/headers/113/195/975/057/516/891/original/a03823d66c58ea5b.jpeg"],"header_static":["https://files.mastodon.social/cache/accounts/headers/113/195/975/057/516/891/original/a03823d66c58ea5b.jpeg"],"followers_count":[596],"following_count":[446],"statuses_count":[599],"fields":[{"name":"CodeBerg","value":"<a href=\"https://codeberg.org/ramin_hal9001\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">https://codeberg.org/ramin_hal9001<\/a>"},{"name":"Blog","value":"<a href=\"https://tilde.town/~ramin_hal9001\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">https://tilde.town/~ramin_hal9001<\/a>"},{"name":"GitHub","value":"<a href=\"https://github.com/RaminHAL9001\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">https://github.com/RaminHAL9001<\/a>"},{"name":"Lemmy","value":"<a href=\"https://lemmy.ml/u/Ramin_HAL9001\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">https://lemmy.ml/u/Ramin_HAL9001<\/a>"},{"name":"NeoCities","value":"<a href=\"https://ramin-honary.neocities.org\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">https://ramin-honary.neocities.org<\/a>"}],"emojis":[]}
