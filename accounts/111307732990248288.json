I feel like I change everyday.  Professionally, I am a web developer, but I don't talk about it much.  I love art of all kinds - poetry, writing, painting, drawing, videogames, and movies. I sometimes write or draw, but I'm far from talented in those efforts. There is a lot of stuff I care about - climate, inclusion, accessibility, and kindness.  Sometimes I feel unable to help the world, but I try my best.<\/p>"],"url":["https://mastodon.sdf.org/@poetryben"],"avatar":["https://files.mastodon.social/cache/accounts/avatars/111/307/732/990/248/288/original/7dff2396007659e1.jpg"],"avatar_static":["https://files.mastodon.social/cache/accounts/avatars/111/307/732/990/248/288/original/7dff2396007659e1.jpg"],"header":["https://mastodon.social/headers/original/missing.png"],"header_static":["https://mastodon.social/headers/original/missing.png"],"followers_count":[118],"following_count":[437],"statuses_count":[207],"fields":[],"emojis":[]}
