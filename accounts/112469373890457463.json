(are these things weird to put in a bio? probably, but i hadn't talked to anyone in ages so i am a little weird rn. + i can always rewrite it + i come here to be weird) sorry if i don't answer to a reply or a mention - sometimes i run out of words ∧/∨ forget to reply.<\/p><p>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<\/p><p>i've been on tumblr for 11+ years, now i'm trying to settle in the fediverse. this is my main account where i girlblog and shitpost and share my litte thoughts. my other fedi account is @fizzymuse@mastodon.world - i plan to culture/museumpost there, check it out if you want to!<\/p><p>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<\/p><p>you can also find me on soulseek as fizzyday, check out my taste in music if you like:)<\/p><p>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<\/p><p>my current profile image is from https://picrew.me/en/image_maker/1469769<\/p>"],"url":["https://app.wafrn.net/fediverse/blog/fizzyday"],"avatar":["https://files.mastodon.social/cache/accounts/avatars/112/469/373/890/457/463/original/1c2a5fc0762c0467.webp"],"avatar_static":["https://files.mastodon.social/cache/accounts/avatars/112/469/373/890/457/463/original/1c2a5fc0762c0467.webp"],"header":["https://mastodon.social/headers/original/missing.png"],"header_static":["https://mastodon.social/headers/original/missing.png"],"followers_count":[36],"following_count":[47],"statuses_count":[655],"fields":[],"emojis":[],"discoverable":[true]}
