The mission of Runestone is to \"democratize textbooks for the 21st century\". To accomplish that mission we make high quality interactive textbooks available for free to all students.  In the 21st century it is silly to ignore the wonderful possibilities for interactivity in a web browser, so we make great interactive textbooks that engage students in learning.  It would also be silly to ignore the rich data that an online textbook can provide to students, teachers, authors and researchers.  To support these different stakeholders we have created a Learning Engineering and Analytics Portal (LEAP).  You can read more about that on our site.\nI publish my personal blog on A Reputable Journal where I write about biking, travel, cooking, drinking wine, and miscellaneous hacking things.\n"],"url":["https://micro.blog/activitypub/bnmnetp"],"uri":["https://micro.blog/activitypub/bnmnetp"],"avatar":["https://files.mastodon.social/cache/accounts/avatars/109/786/800/234/242/924/original/a506b78441fb83af.jpg"],"avatar_static":["https://files.mastodon.social/cache/accounts/avatars/109/786/800/234/242/924/original/a506b78441fb83af.jpg"],"header":["https://mastodon.social/headers/original/missing.png"],"header_static":["https://mastodon.social/headers/original/missing.png"],"followers_count":[4],"following_count":[28],"statuses_count":[199],"last_status_at":["2024-10-27"],"hide_collections":[true],"emojis":[],"fields":[{"name":["Blog"],"value":["<a href=\"https://reputablejournal.com/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">reputablejournal.com<\/a>"],"verified_at":{}}]}
