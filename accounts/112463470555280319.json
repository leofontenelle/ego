I've been to places from Bolivia to Bangladesh, Mongolia to Morocco, Pakistan to Portugal. I run a digital production company by day and travel in school holidays as much as my pennies will allow. Last time I checked I had twins. They are my baggage handlers. I'm new to YouTube as of Dec 2021..looking forward to uploading content.
