Typing things out and then reading them back really works for me.<\/p>"],"url":["https://mastodon.social/@frogsareevil"],"avatar":["https://mastodon.social/avatars/original/missing.png"],"avatar_static":["https://mastodon.social/avatars/original/missing.png"],"header":["https://mastodon.social/headers/original/missing.png"],"header_static":["https://mastodon.social/headers/original/missing.png"],"followers_count":[2],"following_count":[12],"statuses_count":[45],"fields":[{"name":"Website","value":"<a href=\"https://www.frogsareevil.co.uk\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer me\" translate=\"no\"><span class=\"invisible\">https://www.<\/span><span class=\"\">frogsareevil.co.uk<\/span><span class=\"invisible\"><\/span><\/a>"}],"emojis":[],"discoverable":[null]}
