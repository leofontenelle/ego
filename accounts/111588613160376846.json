The camera is pointed southwest from the easternmost shore of Quonochontaug Pond in Charlestown, RI, USA. I was hanging my food in a bear bag from a tree in the backyard of my parents home - practicing for my impending Appalachian Trail thru hike. The sun had already set and we were deep into the blue hour, but the sky is a beautiful blue to orange ombre that reflects off the pond. Two days later the AT was closed due to Covid-19."],"url":["https://allies.rocks/users/liminoid_space"],"uri":["https://allies.rocks/users/liminoid_space"],"avatar":["https://files.mastodon.social/cache/accounts/avatars/111/588/613/160/376/846/original/20b76171be396b62.jpg"],"avatar_static":["https://files.mastodon.social/cache/accounts/avatars/111/588/613/160/376/846/original/20b76171be396b62.jpg"],"header":["https://files.mastodon.social/cache/accounts/headers/111/588/613/160/376/846/original/b5d5d330eda81a1f.jpg"],"header_static":["https://files.mastodon.social/cache/accounts/headers/111/588/613/160/376/846/original/b5d5d330eda81a1f.jpg"],"followers_count":[54],"following_count":[338],"statuses_count":[13],"last_status_at":["2023-12-25"],"hide_collections":[false],"emojis":[],"fields":[{"name":["Pronouns"],"value":["she/her"],"verified_at":{}}]}
