My first camera was a Konica Z-UP 110 after I Upgrade to the Konica Z-UP 120 then the Konica Z-Up 150. In 2005 I jump to Digital with Kodak EasyShare DX4530, then in 2008 the Fujifilm FinePix S2000HD. Since 2014 I was using Fujifilm X-A2 I sold it now. I can say that I was really miss a viewfinder that I found easier to shoot with it. So in the near future I will buy the Sony A7 Mark II. My two strengths are Portrait and Macro.<\/p>"],"url":["https://mastodon.social/@Mikaeru6"],"uri":["https://mastodon.social/users/Mikaeru6"],"avatar":["https://files.mastodon.social/accounts/avatars/000/851/964/original/c5090fe6bad5038c.jpg"],"avatar_static":["https://files.mastodon.social/accounts/avatars/000/851/964/original/c5090fe6bad5038c.jpg"],"header":["https://files.mastodon.social/accounts/headers/000/851/964/original/ac1191c56073e9c1.jpg"],"header_static":["https://files.mastodon.social/accounts/headers/000/851/964/original/ac1191c56073e9c1.jpg"],"followers_count":[1],"following_count":[4],"statuses_count":[0],"last_status_at":{},"hide_collections":{},"noindex":[false],"emojis":[],"roles":[],"fields":[]}
