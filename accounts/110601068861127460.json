My lab investigates the mechanisms used by sleep to consolidate memories, gain insight, and resolve emotional distress. The National Institute of Mental Health provides grant funding  and I have 6 PhD students, 1 postdoctoral scholar, a lab technician and 6 undergraduates conducting the research. I hope to use sleep mechanisms to cure PTSD, drug addiction, and other mental and neurological conditions.<\/p>"],"url":["https://neuromatch.social/@ginapoe"],"uri":["https://neuromatch.social/users/ginapoe"],"avatar":["https://files.mastodon.social/cache/accounts/avatars/110/601/068/861/127/460/original/cb5931bac7c3cf6c.jpeg"],"avatar_static":["https://files.mastodon.social/cache/accounts/avatars/110/601/068/861/127/460/original/cb5931bac7c3cf6c.jpeg"],"header":["https://files.mastodon.social/cache/accounts/headers/110/601/068/861/127/460/original/61969e918d395507.jpg"],"header_static":["https://files.mastodon.social/cache/accounts/headers/110/601/068/861/127/460/original/61969e918d395507.jpg"],"followers_count":[856],"following_count":[7],"statuses_count":[1],"last_status_at":["2023-06-24"],"hide_collections":[false],"emojis":[],"fields":[]}
