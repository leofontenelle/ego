I used to be in Scottish grunge pioneers, The Cateran. More recently used to have a stop-motion animation studio called Ko Lik Films. I was a screenwriter for around twenty years but these days I'm much happier being a writer for Americana UK. I like Gibson acoustic guitars and I run like I like my music... slow and sad.
