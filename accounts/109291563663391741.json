Iâ€™m a dad and husband living in Maine, USA. I believe in the restorative power of the outdoors. I believe the candidate who wins an election should take office, and support the peaceful transition of power. I work as a data professional, focusing on data democratization, stewardship, and governance. I find my work in the intersection of business and IT, supporting a marketing organization.
