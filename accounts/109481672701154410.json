Glad to be here.  Work in mental health. Enjoy watching movies, eating out with friends, cooking, reading, gardening, playing the piano, travel, and meeting people.  Also an introvert    As soon as I can get most of the people I’m following on the bird site over here I’m leaving.  If Elton John isn’t there why stay?   Oh I like music too mostly songs from 60’s, 70’s, 80’s, 90’s.
