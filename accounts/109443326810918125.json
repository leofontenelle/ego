I remember thursday night dinners in SF. Hanging out with the same peeps IRL as in the nascent www world.  After quiet quiting fb and twitter 5 years ago and missing nothing, am testing the waters here. Pleasantly surprised by the collegial atmosphere. Mostly listening to and boosting old friends and experts whose work I respect. None of my views are original. If I say something, it came from a reliable source.
